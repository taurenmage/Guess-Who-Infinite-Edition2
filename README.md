# Guess-Who-Infinite-Edition2

This is a version of Guess Who which instead of using predetermined characters uses probabalisitcally generated characters 
based on various different options of a long list of traits that range from hair to mouths to shirts.

The goal is to create a version of Guess Who that never runs out of the novelty factor of characters. 
This creates new characters each time but also creates new challenges because players will have to pick up on and adjust to the new patterns,
instead of relying on past experience solely.

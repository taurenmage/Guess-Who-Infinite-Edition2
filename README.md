# Guess-Who-Infinite-Edition

A version of Guess Who with probabalisitcally generated characters.

The goal is to create a version of Guess Who that never runs out of the novelty factor of characters. 
This creates new characters with new traits ranging from hair to mouths to shirts;
and thus new challenges as players adjust to new patterns,
rather than rely on experience.

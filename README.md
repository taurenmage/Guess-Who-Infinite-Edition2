# Guess-Who-Infinite-Edition

A version of Guess Who with probabalisitcally generated characters.

The goal's a version of Guess Who that, each play, has new characters,
ranging from hair to mouths to shirts;
and thus new challenges as players adjust to new patterns,
rather than rely on experience.

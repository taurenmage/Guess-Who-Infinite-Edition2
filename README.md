# Guess-Who-Infinite-Edition

A version of Guess Who with probabalisitcally generated characters.

The goal is to create a version of Guess Who that has new characters each time. 
New characters with new traits ranging from hair to mouths to shirts;
and thus new challenges as players adjust to new patterns,
rather than rely on experience.
